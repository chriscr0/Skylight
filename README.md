A chome extension that replaces the new tab page with an uncluttered UI and beautiful wallpapers. Every new tab displays one of over 700 different wallpapers.

The list of wallpapers used in this project are the same images that are used in the Google Chromecast "featured images" backdrop setting. The [chromecast-backgrounds](https://github.com/dconnolly/chromecast-backgrounds) GitHub project has a list of these backgrounds compiled, and is used by this project.
